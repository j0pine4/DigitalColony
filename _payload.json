I could use Houdini to generate the terrain and scatter the geometry, use USD to pass all that data along to Katana, and finally get those sweet renders out using Renderman. So I have my subject and tools lined up, now it’s time to build the USD plugins and get to work. Easy right?

I found the cake material to be a particularly fun challenge. Initially I wanted to use photo maps and I actually baked a cake, but unfortunately I don’t own a good camera so I couldnt get good high enough quality images to use. The cake I baked also didn’t have quite the right texture. Ultimately I used a ramp to split the dark and light cake textures, and layered a variety of noise passes together in the color, roughness, bump, and displacement channels to create the final product.

When someone criticizes your work, it’s very easy to take it personally. We have put so much time and effort into the piece that when someone says something negative about it, we get hurt, annoyed, and sometimes angry. But, it is very important to run the critique through your logic and reason filters in your brain. We need to remember that 9 times out of 10, the person giving the feedback is trying to help you make your work better. And even if you disagree with the comments, take it in and put it to the side. If you hear multiple people telling you the same things, more likely than not you’re the one who needs to learn to see that your execution of the work could be better, or worse yet, not accepting the feedback as valid because that particular issue is “what I was trying to say/show”.",[22,1047,1048,1049,1052],{},"The “not seeing” issue is easy to solve.

They don’t look at their work objectively and after a while, no one will bother critiquing them because they know it’s futile; and that’s unfortunate.",[22,1054,1055],{},"Alternatively, when giving feedback, it’s easy to say that you don’t like something, but that doesn’t give enough information and is not really helpful to the person creating the work.

I said that I thought the acting was good, the writing was good, the directing and production quality was all good. It was a perfectly acceptable show. But, I’m not a big fan. It’s just not my cup of tea. But that doesn’t mean that I couldn’t see that the show was executed really well.

We can look at the other areas in the image and see that they don’t match with the CG that has been added.",[22,1073,1074],{},"I go to art shows around town a couple times a year and I see people reuse materials to create collages, or designs from keyboard keys, and they are executed really well.

There are no areas that look like the artist just gave up halfway through, where they decided “Meh, I don’t need to trim this excess fabric” and now there is a bunch of frayed threads everywhere.

As an example, I teach lighting and look development, so I might say something like “I like this lighting, you’re getting nice shape from the object, but the edge is blending into the background over here. If you take another light and create a rim to show off the silhouette, that should solve that.”. In those two sentences I’ve gone through each stage of the critique.

Let’s say I painted a picture of a rancher riding a horse in the plains. Someone comes back and says “This is dumb, it looks like Ant-Man riding a turd in a sewer.” Instead of taking that personally, one should step back, think objectively, and really look at it. You might find that, yes, you could have defined the horse into more than three brown circles and no legs and make the grass look more like grass and not dirty water flowing to a sunset that looks like an opening in a storm drain.

Critiquing work by other people allows one to learn how to analyze things in different ways, and might even be an inspiration for work down the road. It also helps the artist by giving them what they need to get better. But without quality feedback it’s all pointless. Just always take the negatives and flip them to a positive.
