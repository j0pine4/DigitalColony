# Chocolate Cake

## By: Krista Goll

After months of working on my stylized final environment at VFS, I decided to spend a couple weeks on a small-scale, realistic modeling and look dev project. I also wanted to work with organic objects and materials since I’ve noticed my work is lacking in that area. All materials are procedural except for the mint leaves, cutting board, the bump mapping on the bottom side of some of the blueberries, and the cut side of the halved strawberries. I found the cake material to be a particularly fun challenge. Initially I wanted to use photo maps and I actually baked a cake, but unfortunately I don’t own a good camera so I couldnt get good high enough quality images to use. The cake I baked also didn’t have quite the right texture. Ultimately I used a ramp to split the dark and light cake textures, and layered a variety of noise passes together in the color, roughness, bump, and displacement channels to create the final product. I’ve included some of my shading networks below. I rendered separate foreground and background plates, and composited the final image in Nuke.

Software Used: Autodesk Maya, Arnold, Adobe Photoshop, Substance Painter, Nuke, Xgen (for the cloth)
