# 10000 Hours Later

## By: Dominique Buttiens

I got approached by Nastya Ermakova, who runs the Instagram ‘10000 Hours Later’. It’s an interesting initiative with a simple concept. An artist compares their oldest and newest artwork, together with one or two sentences of advice for less experienced artists. (You can find the Instagram here: <https://www.instagram.com/10000hourslater/>)

It was an interesting opportunity to reflect on the artwork I just finished and to think about how long it had been since I first tried 3D. I went digging through an old back-up and found my very first 3d-model ever. By sheer coincidence it turned out both my oldest and newest artwork were a robot head! Definitely feels ironic as I am more an environments artist. (Sidenote: I do think I got the date wrong, the old piece might actually be from 2011) When it came to the advice part, I tried to keep it simple and think of what I noticed a lot of students struggle with, and what ended up helping me the most throughout the years.

> *“The trick is to keep practicing, don’t feel intimidated by more experienced artists, but instead focus on your own progress. Don’t forget about your art fundamentals like composition, color, light & sense of scale. Tools and software will always change, but the fundamentals will always help you!”*

I also found my 2nd ever 3D model, which as it turns out is something I also ended up making again in recent years. A locomotive!

*So really, if you look at it, all I learned in seven years is how to add color. + I should model a train with a robothead.*

I personally really like the project ‘10000 Hours Later’, it shows new artists that the more experienced artists also had to start somehwere. For me it has been roughly seven years, of which about 4-5 years I’ve spent as a professional. I hadn’t really thought about how long it had been until now, it’s been a crazy ride with ups and downs. I’ve met a lot of wonderful people and I still really enjoy the challenges that get thrown at you in the games industry, things move fast and keep changing. It can be quite intense to keep up with it all, but it’s fun and I wouldn’t want to change it. During these past 5 years, I’ve devoted most of my time to my career and personal growth. This wasn’t always easy. If there would be one piece of advice I’d give my younger self, it’d be this: Don’t mistake a large amount of working hours for good work. You do not have to work insane hours to grow or deliver good work. Take time to research, study and plan. Do good, focused, concentrated work, instead of many, many, many late hours of mediocre work. And take time for yourself, take care of your body and your mind, you only have 1 life and it deserves living. I also want to mention, that I’ve been quite lucky during these past 5+ years. No matter how high or how low, I’ve always had the support and understanding of my wonderful partner. She’s also an artist, an illustrator and a very driven person as well, which does make it a lot easier to understand each other. I’ll share some of her work below, definitely check her out if you like fantasy paintings
