# The “How To” Guide To A Good Critique page

## By: Tom Bremer

As a professional artist for over 10 years, I’ve had plenty of people critique my work. The quality of said critiques were all over the map, ranging from amazing to atrocious. But in every case, there is always something you can take away from the feedback to later apply to your work. And the thing about critiques is, it’s not just for artists. All professions can benefit from a good critique.

Giving and receiving critique is difficult. When someone criticizes your work, it’s very easy to take it personally. We have put so much time and effort into the piece that when someone says something negative about it, we get hurt, annoyed, and sometimes angry. But, it is very important to run the critique through your logic and reason filters in your brain. We need to remember that 9 times out of 10, the person giving the feedback is trying to help you make your work better. And even if you disagree with the comments, take it in and put it to the side. If you hear multiple people telling you the same things, more likely than not you’re the one who needs to learn to see that your execution of the work could be better, or worse yet, not accepting the feedback as valid because that particular issue is “what I was trying to say/show”.

The “not seeing” issue is easy to solve. Provided the critic gave adequate information of *why* a certain part doesn’t work, over time you will learn how to prevent that problem from showing up in future work.. When you choose not to accept the feedback because of your ego, that’s when there is very little anyone can do for you. When someone gives feedback on that person’s work, the critic is often met with excuses or reasons why it looks a certain way, and refuses to implement changes. They don’t look at their work objectively and after a while, no one will bother critiquing them because they know it’s futile; and that’s unfortunate.

Alternatively, when giving feedback, it’s easy to say that you don’t like something, but that doesn’t give enough information and is not really helpful to the person creating the work. There are three main points that should be in every critique given. When these three points are utilized, the person receiving the feedback will be able to take that information, to learn from it, and to implement it.

**Is it executed well?**

The first point is whether or not the work is executed well. This is not “do I like the work?”. Art is intensely subjective and some people might not like something just because it doesn’t appeal to them. An example I said to a friend a few months back was regarding a certain TV show. My partner likes it so I watch it with her, and when we were explaining it to our friend, I told her what I thought. I said that I thought the acting was good, the writing was good, the directing and production quality was all good. It was a perfectly acceptable show. But, I’m not a big fan. It’s just not my cup of tea. But that doesn’t mean that I couldn’t see that the show was executed really well. In order to give a good critique we must look at the work objectively, otherwise the rest of the critique will be pointless.

**What could be made better?**

The next point is to explain what issues you have with the work. Speaking in artist terms, and again, trying to be as objective as possible, we can say things like the perspective of the piece is not quite right or divergent, the lighting angle on the subject is not matching the film plate, or these objects scale seems too large/small to the rest of the scene, etc. These are the technical executions that have no real bearing against a creative vision and are not necessarily a personal opinion. We can look at the other areas in the image and see that they don’t match with the CG that has been added.

I go to art shows around town a couple times a year and I see people reuse materials to create collages, or designs from keyboard keys, and they are executed really well. There is a nice polish on the project. By that I mean, it just looks finished. There are no areas that look like the artist just gave up halfway through, where they decided “Meh, I don’t need to trim this excess fabric” and now there is a bunch of frayed threads everywhere. You could argue that that is a statement for the uncertainty of life or something, but I could argue that me as a viewer didn’t see that, so the execution is not as refined as it could be.

**How can it be fixed?**

The final point is to offer how the work could be fixed. In my class, I always try to explain what I think could be improved on, and then I explain *how* it can be improved on. As an example, I teach lighting and look development, so I might say something like “I like this lighting, you’re getting nice shape from the object, but the edge is blending into the background over here. If you take another light and create a rim to show off the silhouette, that should solve that.”. In those two sentences I’ve gone through each stage of the critique. I’ve stated that I thought it was executed decently, but had an issue, and explained how to solve the issue.

**Don’t take it personally**

In the end no matter what someone says, you should always be able to take it and spin it to a positive. Let’s say I painted a picture of a rancher riding a horse in the plains. Someone comes back and says “This is dumb, it looks like Ant-Man riding a turd in a sewer.” Instead of taking that personally, one should step back, think objectively, and really look at it. You might find that, yes, you could have defined the horse into more than three brown circles and no legs and make the grass look more like grass and not dirty water flowing to a sunset that looks like an opening in a storm drain. Actually, at the point, I would probably just say it was Ant-Man riding a turd in a sewer.

**TL;DR**

Critiquing is a necessary thing that helps both the artist and the criticizer. Critiquing work by other people allows one to learn how to analyze things in different ways, and might even be an inspiration for work down the road. It also helps the artist by giving them what they need to get better. But without quality feedback it’s all pointless. Just always take the negatives and flip them to a positive. If things are still unclear, here is a handy flowchart for which you can refer.
