# 2 Minute Cliffs In Houdini

## By: Simon Verstraete

This weeks post is about how you can generate a cliff. I made again a 2min video about it so you will have a good idea on how it is made. 

In general there is a lot of information out there about rocks generation. Of course most videos about it are long videos and here is then a 2min video that gives an overview on the cliff generation. You could use this setup for making stones and other type of rocks. By playing around with the base shapes and different noises.

I hope you enjoy the video
