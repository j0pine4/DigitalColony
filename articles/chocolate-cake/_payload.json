All materials are procedural except for the mint leaves, cutting board, the bump mapping on the bottom side of some of the blueberries, and the cut side of the halved strawberries. I found the cake material to be a particularly fun challenge. Initially I wanted to use photo maps and I actually baked a cake, but unfortunately I don’t own a good camera so I couldnt get good high enough quality images to use. The cake I baked also didn’t have quite the right texture. Ultimately I used a ramp to split the dark and light cake textures, and layered a variety of noise passes together in the color, roughness, bump, and displacement channels to create the final product. I’ve included some of my shading networks below.

For me it has been roughly seven years, of which about 4-5 years I’ve spent as a professional. I hadn’t really thought about how long it had been until now, it’s been a crazy ride with ups and downs. I’ve met a lot of wonderful people and I still really enjoy the challenges that get thrown at you in the games industry, things move fast and keep changing. It can be quite intense to keep up with it all, but it’s fun and I wouldn’t want to change it. During these past 5 years, I’ve devoted most of my time to my career and personal growth. This wasn’t always easy. If there would be one piece of advice I’d give my younger self, it’d be this: Don’t mistake a large amount of working hours for good work. You do not have to work insane hours to grow or deliver good work. Take time to research, study and plan. Do good, focused, concentrated work, instead of many, many, many late hours of mediocre work. And take time for yourself, take care of your body and your mind, you only have 1 life and it deserves living. I also want to mention, that I’ve been quite lucky during these past 5+ years. No matter how high or how low, I’ve always had the support and understanding of my wonderful partner. She’s also an artist, an illustrator and a very driven person as well, which does make it a lot easier to understand each other.

The quality of said critiques were all over the map, ranging from amazing to atrocious. But in every case, there is always something you can take away from the feedback to later apply to your work. And the thing about critiques is, it’s not just for artists. All professions can benefit from a good critique.",[19,713,714],{},"Giving and receiving critique is difficult. When someone criticizes your work, it’s very easy to take it personally. We have put so much time and effort into the piece that when someone says something negative about it, we get hurt, annoyed, and sometimes angry. But, it is very important to run the critique through your logic and reason filters in your brain. We need to remember that 9 times out of 10, the person giving the feedback is trying to help you make your work better. And even if you disagree with the comments, take it in and put it to the side. If you hear multiple people telling you the same things, more likely than not you’re the one who needs to learn to see that your execution of the work could be better, or worse yet, not accepting the feedback as valid because that particular issue is “what I was trying to say/show”.",[19,716,717,718,721],{},"The “not seeing” issue is easy to solve.

When you choose not to accept the feedback because of your ego, that’s when there is very little anyone can do for you. When someone gives feedback on that person’s work, the critic is often met with excuses or reasons why it looks a certain way, and refuses to implement changes. They don’t look at their work objectively and after a while, no one will bother critiquing them because they know it’s futile; and that’s unfortunate.",[19,723,724],{},"Alternatively, when giving feedback, it’s easy to say that you don’t like something, but that doesn’t give enough information and is not really helpful to the person creating the work.

This is not “do I like the work?”. Art is intensely subjective and some people might not like something just because it doesn’t appeal to them. An example I said to a friend a few months back was regarding a certain TV show. My partner likes it so I watch it with her, and when we were explaining it to our friend, I told her what I thought. I said that I thought the acting was good, the writing was good, the directing and production quality was all good. It was a perfectly acceptable show. But, I’m not a big fan. It’s just not my cup of tea. But that doesn’t mean that I couldn’t see that the show was executed really well. In order to give a good critique we must look at the work objectively, otherwise the rest of the critique will be pointless.",[19,734,735],{},[567,736,737],{},"What could be made better?",[19,739,740],{},"The next point is to explain what issues you have with the work.

We can look at the other areas in the image and see that they don’t match with the CG that has been added.",[19,742,743],{},"I go to art shows around town a couple times a year and I see people reuse materials to create collages, or designs from keyboard keys, and they are executed really well. There is a nice polish on the project. By that I mean, it just looks finished. There are no areas that look like the artist just gave up halfway through, where they decided “Meh, I don’t need to trim this excess fabric” and now there is a bunch of frayed threads everywhere. You could argue that that is a statement for the uncertainty of life or something, but I could argue that me as a viewer didn’t see that, so the execution is not as refined as it could be.",[19,745,746],{},[567,747,748],{},"How can it be fixed?",[19,750,751,752,755],{},"The final point is to offer how the work could be fixed.

As an example, I teach lighting and look development, so I might say something like “I like this lighting, you’re getting nice shape from the object, but the edge is blending into the background over here. If you take another light and create a rim to show off the silhouette, that should solve that.”. In those two sentences I’ve gone through each stage of the critique.

You might find that, yes, you could have defined the horse into more than three brown circles and no legs and make the grass look more like grass and not dirty water flowing to a sunset that looks like an opening in a storm drain.
