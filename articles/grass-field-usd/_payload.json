Houdini and USD. So of course the logical progression was to create a personal project using both! But what to make? After a flurry of awful ideas, I figured that grass seemed to be the perfect candidate. I could use Houdini to generate the terrain and scatter the geometry, use USD to pass all that data along to Katana, and finally get those sweet renders out using Renderman. So I have my subject and tools lined up, now it’s time to build the USD plugins and get to work. Easy right? Well what followed was two months of stumbling through forums and online resources to iron out all of the wrinkles that came with this project.

This wasn’t always easy. If there would be one piece of advice I’d give my younger self, it’d be this: Don’t mistake a large amount of working hours for good work. You do not have to work insane hours to grow or deliver good work. Take time to research, study and plan. Do good, focused, concentrated work, instead of many, many, many late hours of mediocre work. And take time for yourself, take care of your body and your mind, you only have 1 life and it deserves living. I also want to mention, that I’ve been quite lucky during these past 5+ years. No matter how high or how low, I’ve always had the support and understanding of my wonderful partner.

I said that I thought the acting was good, the writing was good, the directing and production quality was all good. It was a perfectly acceptable show. But, I’m not a big fan. It’s just not my cup of tea. But that doesn’t mean that I couldn’t see that the show was executed really well. In order to give a good critique we must look at the work objectively, otherwise the rest of the critique will be pointless.",[21,952,953],{},[760,954,955],{},"What could be made better?",[21,957,958],{},"The next point is to explain what issues you have with the work. Speaking in artist terms, and again, trying to be as objective as possible, we can say things like the perspective of the piece is not quite right or divergent, the lighting angle on the subject is not matching the film plate, or these objects scale seems too large/small to the rest of the scene, etc. These are the technical executions that have no real bearing against a creative vision and are not necessarily a personal opinion. We can look at the other areas in the image and see that they don’t match with the CG that has been added.",[21,960,961],{},"I go to art shows around town a couple times a year and I see people reuse materials to create collages, or designs from keyboard keys, and they are executed really well. There is a nice polish on the project. By that I mean, it just looks finished. There are no areas that look like the artist just gave up halfway through, where they decided “Meh, I don’t need to trim this excess fabric” and now there is a bunch of frayed threads everywhere. You could argue that that is a statement for the uncertainty of life or something, but I could argue that me as a viewer didn’t see that, so the execution is not as refined as it could be.",[21,963,964],{},[760,965,966],{},"How can it be fixed?",[21,968,969,970,973],{},"The final point is to offer how the work could be fixed. In my class, I always try to explain what I think could be improved on, and then I explain ",[702,971,972],{},"how"," it can be improved on. As an example, I teach lighting and look development, so I might say something like “I like this lighting, you’re getting nice shape from the object, but the edge is blending into the background over here. If you take another light and create a rim to show off the silhouette, that should solve that.”. In those two sentences I’ve gone through each stage of the critique. I’ve stated that I thought it was executed decently, but had an issue, and explained how to solve the issue.",[21,975,976],{},[760,977,978],{},"Don’t take it personally",[21,980,981],{},"In the end no matter what someone says, you should always be able to take it and spin it to a positive. Let’s say I painted a picture of a rancher riding a horse in the plains. Someone comes back and says “This is dumb, it looks like Ant-Man riding a turd in a sewer.” Instead of taking that personally, one should step back, think objectively, and really look at it. You might find that, yes, you could have defined the horse into more than three brown circles and no legs and make the grass look more like grass and not dirty water flowing to a sunset that looks like an opening in a storm drain. Actually, at the point, I would probably just say it was Ant-Man riding a turd in a sewer.",[21,983,984],{},[760,985,986],{},"TL;DR",[21,988,989],{},"Critiquing is a necessary thing that helps both the artist and the criticizer. Critiquing work by other people allows one to learn how to analyze things in different ways, and might even be an inspiration for work down the road. It also helps the artist by giving them what they need to get better. But without quality feedback it’s all pointless. Just always take the negatives and flip them to a positive.
