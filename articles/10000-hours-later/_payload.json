I’ve met a lot of wonderful people and I still really enjoy the challenges that get thrown at you in the games industry, things move fast and keep changing. It can be quite intense to keep up with it all, but it’s fun and I wouldn’t want to change it. During these past 5 years, I’ve devoted most of my time to my career and personal growth. This wasn’t always easy. If there would be one piece of advice I’d give my younger self, it’d be this: Don’t mistake a large amount of working hours for good work. You do not have to work insane hours to grow or deliver good work. Take time to research, study and plan. Do good, focused, concentrated work, instead of many, many, many late hours of mediocre work. And take time for yourself, take care of your body and your mind, you only have 1 life and it deserves living. I also want to mention, that I’ve been quite lucky during these past 5+ years. No matter how high or how low, I’ve always had the support and understanding of my wonderful partner.

If you hear multiple people telling you the same things, more likely than not you’re the one who needs to learn to see that your execution of the work could be better, or worse yet, not accepting the feedback as valid because that particular issue is “what I was trying to say/show”.",[19,742,743,744,747],{},"The “not seeing” issue is easy to solve.

I said that I thought the acting was good, the writing was good, the directing and production quality was all good. It was a perfectly acceptable show. But, I’m not a big fan. It’s just not my cup of tea. But that doesn’t mean that I couldn’t see that the show was executed really well.

We can look at the other areas in the image and see that they don’t match with the CG that has been added.",[19,768,769],{},"I go to art shows around town a couple times a year and I see people reuse materials to create collages, or designs from keyboard keys, and they are executed really well.

You might find that, yes, you could have defined the horse into more than three brown circles and no legs and make the grass look more like grass and not dirty water flowing to a sunset that looks like an opening in a storm drain.
